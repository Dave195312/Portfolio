        <h1>Welcome to my Resume : This Is Me, Folks! <img src="./Images/dt.jpg" height="100"></h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Hello; my name is Dave Thompson, but you probably knew that already as you've come to my web page.</p>
                <p>I've been around the block a few times. I'm actually retired from full time paid employment these days, but I do the odd bit of fee-paying work here and there for a small number of clients to supplement my meagre pension.</p>
                <p>I started life in heavy engineering in North East England. I'm a mechanical engineer at heart but thanks to being in the right place at the right time I gravitated to systems analysis, programming and project management.</p>
                <p>Over the years I've worked on CNC programming, analysed complex systems, written code for business process and accounting software, contract management and analytical systems, and latterly designed and written web apps for local government in England.</p>
                <p>I've worked in the UK's NHS as a software training manager, designing, writing and delivering training programmes for often complex systems used in the healthcare setting.</p>
                <p>What I'm looking for now is the opportunity to develop in the modern app development sector, in any market, in any business. </p>
                <p>So if you have an interesting proposition, please get in touch!</p>
